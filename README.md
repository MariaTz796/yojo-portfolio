# YOJO Portfolio Starter

This repository was created as part of my application to YOJO.  
It will serve as a space to collect and document my learning progress in Python, QGIS, and data-driven storytelling.  
Over the coming months, I plan to add small-scale projects that experiment with mapping, data analysis, and visualization tools, connecting my background in research and architecture with investigative and civic journalism.
